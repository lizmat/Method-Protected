NAME
====

Method::Protected - add "is protected" trait to methods

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Method::Protected;

my @words = "/usr/share/dict/words".IO.lines;

class Frobnicate {
    has %!hash;
    method pick() is protected { %!hash{@words.pick}++ }
    method hash() is protected { %!hash.clone          }
}

# Set up 2 threads massively updating a single hash
my $frobnicator = Frobnicate.new;
start { loop { $frobnicator.pick }
start { loop { $frobnicator.pick }

# Start reporter
until $frobnicator.hash.elems == @words.elems {
    say $frobnicator.hash.elems;
    sleep .1;
}
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

Method::Protected provides an `is protected` trait to methods in a class. If applied to a method, all calls to that method will be protected by a [Lock](https://docs.raku.org/type/Lock), making sure that any other method call to this method (or any other method protected by the trait) from another thread, will block until the call is finished.

Functionally this is similar to what the [OO::Monitor](https://raku.land/cpan:JNTHN/OO::Monitors) does, except that with this module this logic is only applied to methods that actuall have the `is protected` trait applied.

THEORY OF OPERATION
===================

When the trait is applied on a method, the class of the method id checked whether it already has a `$!LOCK` attribute. If not, then that attribute is added, and the associated accessor method `LOCK` is also added. Then the method will be [wrapped](https://docs.raku.org/routine/wrap) with code that will protect the execution of the original body of the method.

A NOTE OF CAUTION
=================

If the method being protected has an `is raw` or `is rw` trait set, then the protected version will also have that set. However, this is usually used to return a container, which can potentially cause a race-condition **outside** of the protected method because the container **may** contain logic that would execute code in a non-threadsafe manner (e.g. in the autovivification of keys in a hash).

So only use `is raw` or `is rw` on protected methods if you **really** know what you're doing. Generally spoken: don't do that! If you think you need to do this, first find another way to structure your code, e.g. by using [`hyper`](https://docs.raku.org/type/Iterable#method_hyper).
